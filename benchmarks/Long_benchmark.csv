A Da-Lite Polacoat rear projection screen consists of a specially formulated optical coating designed to provide the highest resolution and most accurate color fidelity.

Excellent color contrast properties and ability to deal with uncontrolled ambient light are also present. Features -Single element rear projection screen -180  viewing cone -1 4 thick acrylic substrate -IRUS does not have a fixed focal length so there are no focal length incompatibility issues -Warranted for one year against defects in materials and workmanship  Installation Instructions,Draper M2500 Access Series V Electric Screen  - HDTV 119 diagonal

The Vortex is a marriage of the best features of two rear screen technologies - optical and diffusion. A .5mm Fresnel lens gathers the light from the projector and directs it at a right angle through the screen. As the light exits the screen on the audience side a diffusion medium redistributes the light evenly in all directions - up down left right and center giving an exceptionally wide viewing cone in both the horizontal and vertical axes. An extraordinary center-to-corner brightness ratio gives a uniform brightness witout hot spots. Vortex Features -Vortex is designed to be used with single lens projectors -Projected light is collimated then diffused evenly making the Vortex well suited for use in videowalls and rooms with tiered seating patterns -Charcoal grey tint provides superior color contrast even under harsh ambient light -Diffusion medium is in the acrylic so it can t be scratched or damaged -Warranted for one year against defects in materials and workmanship  Installation Instructions,Startech 6 RJ-45 to DB9 Cisco Console Management Router Cable
